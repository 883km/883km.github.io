        <h1>Explore World's Energy Consumption and Problems</h1>
        <h4>A CS-416 Narrative Visualization Project by Sicheng Meng</h4>
        <p>
            The world lacks safe, low-carbon, cheap large-scale energy alternatives to fossil fuels.<br>
            Until we scale up those alternatives the world will continue to face two energy problems: hundreds of millions of people lack access to sufficient energy; and the dominance of fossil fuels in our energy system drives climate change, and other health impacts such as air pollution.<br>
            To make sure that everyone in the world has access to clean and safe energy, we need to understand energy consumption and its impacts around the world today and how this has changed over time.<br>
            In this project you can find my narrative visualizations relating to energy and you'll be able to play with some of the the charts to explore more about this topic youself
